<div id="article-body">		

			<p>
			<span class="first-word">Part</span> of my journey these past few years has been streamlining my life and placing energy and resources into things that matter to me. And that, my friends, does not include spending hours shopping for clothes and throwing money at seasonal trends. I work in retail so I know the profit margins are greatest in clothing departments -- spending money on clothes just isn't good for your bottom line. If you want to spend less on clothes, I have only one rule for you: Buy less clothes. Look for comfy signature pieces that always work. Don't fall for stuff you'll only wear once. Less is more. People aren't here on earth to ohh and ahhover your clothes. They are here to spend time with you. My fiance always says, "Just because it costs more, doesn't mean it's better." Look for multipurpose clothes. Find something you LOVE and will always wear.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			That said, comfy signature pieces still make you look nice and stylish. Here is an example of a $60 dress I've worn to four weddings. Every time I wear it, people say, "Oh my gawd, I love your dress!!". It's a signature piece because it has stunning cream accents. But it's so subtle and unassuming that people never remember I've worn this dress before. And even if they do, so what? I didn't have to spend money on a new dress I'll never wear again.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I bought this dress in 2010 from a seller I found on Etsy.com. It's made out of a super comfy and breathable hemp material. She no longer makes it but here are three common sense tips on identifying comfy signature pieces:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img1">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress.png"  class="article-image" />
					<span> I am second from the right, sitting next to my always beautiful and ageless mother.</span>
				</div>	
				
				<li>It's always flattering. You can wear it regardless of how you feel that day about your body. This dress is flow-y enough that it's my go-to outfit for bloated days but is also cinched at the waist to always flatter my figure.</li>
				
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img2">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-walking.png"  class="article-image" />
					<span>I am on the right.</span>
				</div>					
				
				<li>Buy something that is super comfortable and light-weight to wear. That way, you can wear it during the summer or layer on a coat during the cooler days. It's appropriate for all seasons! Yes, I live in California but I have layered this dress with tights and a coat for two St. Louis winters. Comfy materials I love include cotton, hemp, and bamboo. Materials I very much dislike: wool, leather, and anything synthetic.</li>
				
				<div class="article-imagewithcaption" id="beauty-art2-img3">
					<img src="imgs/beauty-cheapdress-twins.png" class="article-image"  />
					<br />
					<span>In Taiwan, no less! Here I am with my twin sister. You know which one I am.</span>
				</div>
				
				<li>Buy something that is versatile that you can dress up or down. When I wear red heels with this dress, I look like a rock star. When I dress it down with flats, I look like a comfortable fashionista.</li>
