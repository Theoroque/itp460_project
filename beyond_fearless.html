	<span class="first-word">This</span> past Friday, I officially became Mrs. Dalan. Lane and I had an intimate celebration in Downtown Los Angeles and it was spectacular. 
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	I remember one night a week before the wedding when my twin and I were curled up in bed crying because of how overwhelmed we felt about the wedding. I kept wondering if I made the right decision to have a wedding instead of just eloping. In the end, I have no regrets. To me, having my family and closest friends celebrating with us in gritty LA under sparkly stars made everything worth it. I wish I could go back and relive the day over and over again. In the moment, there were so many things going on that I just couldn't process it all. It was such a personalized event that every detail meant a million things to me. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	 I am so blessed and grateful for the people who made this event possible for us (which is pretty much every guest). They were all committed until the end.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Here is a video of our ceremony processional and exit.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We walked down the aisle to an acoustic version of Taylor Swift's "Fearless". A few days after the wedding, as we were rehashing the event during a final family dinner, "Fearless" played at the restaurant we were at. It's not a popular song and not something I'd ever heard anywhere but online.  I took this as a nod from above acknowledging our wedding. We are truly fearless as we start this new journey together. :-)
