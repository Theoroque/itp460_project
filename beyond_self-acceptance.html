	<span class="first-word">Today</span>, I had Thanksgiving dinner at my Godparents' house. They had another family over and the wife asked if I was still working in retail. "Oh no, I quit right before my wedding because I felt like I was betraying myself everyday at work." And so on. She said, "Wow, every time we see you, it seems like you had just quit a job." Her comment made me face a reality I tried not to think about. I counted and I've had eight jobs in the last two and half years. From being a receptionist at an insurance company to a creative writer for a start-up, I am a serial job-hopper. My pattern is always the same. I get very excited for a job opportunity, bring my A game to work, and then very quickly realize I am disengaged and start dreading going to work. Of course, I am not in this state of dread for very long because then I would go to my boss and be more honest than most employees would ever think of being. In fact, I went to the CEO of a company I worked for once and told him I did not like my job. The aftermath of that conversation can be saved for another post.

	As Oprah loves to say, this realization that I've had so many different jobs in such a short amount of time became my "Ah-ha!" moment. Ah-ha! Maybe I am just not cut out to work a "normal" job. The nine to five desk job, working in an industry no one could possibly be passionate about, is just not for me. I don't want to climb the corporate ladder. I want to carve my own path and work on projects that keep me up at night feeling like electricity is flowing through my body. I don't want to think, in five years, I should be promoted to a director and in seven years, I will be a vice president. These arbitrary titles mean nothing to me. I accept that I am not the norm, that I have the courage to say, I DON'T WANT THESE THINGS! I want to go to bed at night knowing that I spent my precious, God-given time on something that contributes to the betterment of humanity as a whole, something that extends beyond just a company's mission statement. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I could mope and think, what is wrong with me?! Why can't I be like my peers and just stay with a company? Why do I always stick out like a sore thumb? But today, I am accepting that I want something else, something more. I accept that I want to live the courageous life and not work just for financial gain. Today, I know this sense of urgency I feel in having to do something more with my life must be fully explored and acted upon. Today, I will have FAITH that something will break my fall from corporate America. And for that, I am very grateful.
