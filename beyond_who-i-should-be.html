	<p>
	<span class="first-word">Something</span> I've struggled with for years, and still sometimes struggle with, is the concept of who I should be versus who I am. Even though the expectations for people in my demographic are mostly implicit, the pressure of my "should be's" are strong. I should be career driven. I should put off having kids until I have my foot in the door (what door?) and my career defined. I should be part of the rat race and constantly upgrade the "toys" (house, cars, etc.) in my life. I should eat a healthy balanced diet with a little bit of everything. Meat and animal products included. I should put more time into managing how people perceive me and grow my network. I should want more, bigger, and better. Always. But I don't.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I'm done putting energy into things I am supposed to care about. I now want to focus on things that actually matter to me in life. Like my family. My hubby. My health. The simple, organic lifestyle. My happiness and well-being. My community. I want my husband to join me in the freedom lifestyle, to not be over-worked and stressed. But how? How do we carve our path when this society clearly supports a way of life we don't want? We are finding the answers to our questions, slowly but surely. We question everything along the way, and know that the best thing we can do is to trust our hearts. The journey is not clearly defined, and there is no end. But we have committed to letting go of the should be's. And that is a good enough start for us.
	</p>
	<p>
	My words have been few recently, as much of my journey is inward for now. Lots of healing and growth are taking place. But I wish to share it all with the world one day. To share the light and love that exists.
