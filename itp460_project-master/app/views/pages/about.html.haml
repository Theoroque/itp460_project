      Welcome to From Foodie 2 Fruity! This website is written by twin sisters who have both drastically transformed their health and lives in the last few years by embracing a plant-based diet and natural lifestyle. Even though Candice and Christine currently live on opposite coasts of the U.S., their shared passion for enjoying a vibrant and colorful life keeps their hearts as close as ever.

        %span.first-word> Hello
        \. My name is Candice Dalan and I am a true Aquarian: free-spirited, independent, and intellectual. I love all things whimsical, colorful, and creative.

        I am on a journey to make my time here on Earth worthwhile. I believe everyone has a life purpose and I am close to finding mine. I want a space to document the crazy things I've learned about life and to connect with those on the same wave length. I want to share my revelations and not feel so crazy for feeling the way I do about things, for seeing things the way I do. I will write about jobs, my high-carb/low-fat vegan lifestyle, relationships, personal development, minimalism, and everything in between.
